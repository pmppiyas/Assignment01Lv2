# ⛳Typescript Based Problem Solve Assignment🥅....

## 🎯Project Overview
This repository contains my first assignment on TypeScript by a Next Level backend focus course, where I solve 8 TypeScript based problem. The assignment covers key topics such as Type Annotations, Interfaces, Generics, Class, Inheritance,Type guard,Access modifier and more.

## ✅*Learned Key* :
- **TypeScript Fundamental**: I learned to implement type annotations, interfaces, generics, classes, inheritance, enums, decorators, mapped types, utility types, strict mode, async handling, and more in TypeScript↘️↘️↘️
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, making it more modular, reusable, and scalable. It revolves around four key principles:
- Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to data and methods, ensuring controlled interaction.
- Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details, exposing only necessary functionalities.
- Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another, promoting code reuse.💡
- Polymorphism: Enables objects to take multiple forms, allowing flexibility in method execution.


- **Access Modifier** : Access modifiers in TypeScript control how class properties and methods can be accessed. The three main types are:

- Public: Accessible from anywhere (default behavior).
- Private: Only accessible within the same class, preventing external modification.
- Protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses but not outside them.

  


## ❤️*Advantance Of TypeScript*
TypeScript significantly improves code quality and project maintainability, making it an excellent choice for scalable applications. It catches errors at compile time instead of runtime, helping you avoid frustrating debugging sessions. It enforces type safety, making functions and variables predictable.


This reduces the risk of unintended behavior by ensuring variables, functions, and components adhere to expected contracts. Strongly typed structures make it easier to understand and refactor code, which is crucial for long-term projects.


It supports encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling modular, scalable architectures. Enhances code reusability and extensibility, making your apps more adaptable to future updates. TypeScript also allows better type guards and generics, ensuring flexibility while maintaining type safety.


Seamless Integration with Modern Frameworks
like Next.js, React, Redux, and GraphQL. It enforces strict prop and state typing, preventing unexpected runtime errors 🐞🪲.
