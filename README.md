# Typescript Based Problem Solve Assignment....

## Project Overview
This repository contains my first assignment on TypeScript, where I solve 7 TypeScript based problem. The assignment covers key topics such as Type Annotations, Interfaces, Generics, Class, Inheritance,Type guard,Access modifier and more.

### Learned Key:
- **TypeScript Fundamental**: Implementing type annotations, interfaces, generics, classes, and inheritance and more...
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, making it more modular, reusable, and scalable. It revolves around four key principles:
- Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to data and methods, ensuring controlled interaction.
- Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details, exposing only necessary functionalities.
- Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another, promoting code reuse.
- Polymorphism: Enables objects to take multiple forms, allowing flexibility in method execution.


- **Access Modifier** : Access modifiers in TypeScript control how class properties and methods can be accessed. The three main types are:

- Public: Accessible from anywhere (default behavior).
- Private: Only accessible within the same class, preventing external modification.
- Protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses but not outside them.
